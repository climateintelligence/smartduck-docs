  abstract = {Impact modeling forced by climate data is often connected with big
	data processing. But impact modelers are often not equipped with
	appropriate hardware (computing and storage facilities) or appropriate
	programming experience. Web Processing Service (WPS) is an open standard
	defined by the Open Spatial Consortium (OGC). It is an interface
	to perform processes over the HTTP network protocol. This tutorial
	in an introduction to an early stage of the ClimDaPs project. ClimDaPs
	is using WPS for climate data processing. It is based on the PyWPS
	implementation of WPS and provides additionally a simple web-based
	user-interface to access and combine climate data processes. It provides
	access to the climate data archive of the Earth System Grid Federation
	(ESGF) for CMIP5 and CORDEX data. Performing simple processes of
	climate data up to complex impact models are already available within
	ClimDaPs. One can also visualize climate data and processed results.
	Besides the introduction of existing processing possibilities, we
	will show how you can add your own climate data processes to ClimDaPs
	and other WPS services.},

  abstract = {Data play a central role in most fields of science. In recent years,
	the amount of data from experiment, observation, and simulation has
	increased rapidly and data complexity has grown. Also, communities
	and shared storage have become geographically more distributed. Therefore,
	methods and techniques applied to scientific data need to be revised
	and partially be replaced, while keeping the community-specific needs
	in focus. The German Helmholtz Association project "Large Scale Data
	Management and Analysis" (LSDMA) aims to maximize the efficiency
	of data life cycles in different research areas, ranging from high
	energy physics to systems biology. In its five Data Life Cycle Labs
	(DLCLs), data experts closely collaborate with the communities in
	joint research and development to optimize the respective data life
	cycle. In addition, the Data Services Integration Team (DSIT) provides
	data analysis tools and services which are common to several DLCLs.
	This paper describes the various activities within LSDMA and focuses
	on the work performed in the DLCLs.},

@article{Wilkinson2016,
abstract = {There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

@article{Bejoy2010,
abstract = {The possibilities and limits of participation at the ‘bottom' (represented, for example, by PRA and PLA) have been well articulated in development literature. However, the emergence of the Knowledge Society has opened up spaces for what we could call participation at the ‘top' (free software, wiki, open access), the implications of which Development Studies is only beginning to grapple with. Building upon recent debates on the issue, we take the cases of the free software movement and participatory development, arguing that they share common ground in several ways. We aim to offer a few pointers on conceptualising development in the Knowledge Society.},

@article{Stockhause2017,
abstract = {Data citations have become widely accepted. Technical infrastructures as well as principles and recommendations for data citation are in place but best practices or guidelines for their implementation are not yet available. On the other hand, the scientific climate community requests early citations on evolving data for credit, e.g. for CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6). The data citation concept for CMIP6 is presented. The main challenges lie in limited resources, a strict project timeline and the dependency on changes of the data dissemination infrastructure ESGF (Earth System Grid Federation) to meet the data citation requirements. Therefore a pragmatic, flexible and extendible approach for the CMIP6 data citation service was developed, consisting of a citation for the full evolving data superset and a data cart approach for citing the concrete used data subset. This two citation approach can be implemented according to the RDA recommendations for evolving data. Because of resource constraints and missing project policies, the implementation of the second part of the citation concept is postponed to CMIP7.},

@article{Weigel2013,
abstract = {Several scientific communities relying on e-science infrastructures are in need of persistent identifiers for data and contextual information. In this article, we present a framework for persistent identification that fundamentally supports context information. It is installed as a number of low-level requirements and abstract data type descriptions, flexible enough to envelope context information while remaining compatible with existing definitions and infrastructures. The abstract data type definitions we draw from the requirements and exemplary use cases can act as an evaluation tool for existing implementations or as a blueprint for future persistent identification infrastructures. A prototypic implementation based on the Handle System is briefly introduced. We also lay the groundwork for establishing a graph of persistent entities that can act as a base layer for more sophisticated information schemas to preserve context information.},

This paper discusses the stakeholders of the OSS community, the quality assurance frameworks and models proposed in some studies, some statistics about OSS, the problems that affect the quality of OSSD, and the advantages and disadvantages of OSS compared to closed source software. This allows us to understand how we can achieve and improve the quality assurance and quality control of OSSD.}
